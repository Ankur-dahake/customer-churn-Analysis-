# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecommunications industry using a comprehensive dataset. The primary objectives are to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, predict which customers are at high risk of leaving, and develop strategies to retain them. By leveraging Power BI for data visualization and Python for predictive modeling, this project aims to provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information about customers, their service usage, and their churn status. Below is a description of each column in the dataset:

1. **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
3. **Age**: Age of the customer.
4. **Married**: Marital status of the customer (Yes/No).
5. **State**: State in which the customer resides.
6. **Number_of_Referrals**: Number of referrals made by the customer.
7. **Tenure_in_Months**: Duration (in months) that the customer has been with the service provider.
8. **Value_Deal**: Indicator if the customer is on a value deal (Yes/No).
9. **Phone_Service**: Indicator if the customer has phone service (Yes/No).
10. **Multiple_Lines**: Indicator if the customer has multiple phone lines (Yes/No).
11. **Internet_Service**: Indicator if the customer has internet service (Yes/No).
12. **Internet_Type**: Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber, No).
13. **Online_Security**: Indicator if the customer has online security service (Yes/No).
14. **Online_Backup**: Indicator if the customer has online backup service (Yes/No).
15. **Device_Protection_Plan**: Indicator if the customer has a device protection plan (Yes/No).
16. **Premium_Support**: Indicator if the customer has premium support service (Yes/No).
17. **Streaming_TV**: Indicator if the customer has streaming TV service (Yes/No).
18. **Streaming_Movies**: Indicator if the customer has streaming movies service (Yes/No).
19. **Streaming_Music**: Indicator if the customer has streaming music service (Yes/No).
20. **Unlimited_Data**: Indicator if the customer has unlimited data plan (Yes/No).
21. **Contract**: Type of contract (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year).
22. **Paperless_Billing**: Indicator if the customer is on paperless billing (Yes/No).
23. **Payment_Method**: Method of payment (Electronic Check, Mailed Check, Bank Transfer, Credit Card).
24. **Monthly_Charge**: Monthly charge for the customer.
25. **Total_Charges**: Total charges incurred by the customer.
26. **Total_Refunds**: Total refunds given to the customer.
27. **Total_Extra_Data_Charges**: Total extra data charges incurred by the customer.
28. **Total_Long_Distance_Charges**: Total long-distance charges incurred by the customer.
29. **Total_Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the customer.
30. **Customer_Status**: Current status of the customer (Active, Inactive).
31. **Churn_Category**: Category of churn (Voluntary, Involuntary).
32. **Churn_Reason**: Reason for churn if applicable.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide insights into customer demographics, service usage, and churn patterns.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Use Python to develop machine learning models that predict the likelihood of customer churn based on various features in the dataset.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify segments of customers with high churn risk and understand the key factors driving their decision to leave.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations and strategies to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to uncover patterns and correlations between different features and churn.
3. **Model Development**: Build and evaluate different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.) to predict customer churn.
4. **Visualization**: Use Power BI to create visualizations that make it easy to understand the data and model results.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the Power BI dashboard and share insights with stakeholders.


## Conclusion

By integrating data visualization with predictive analytics, this project aims to provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and mitigating customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The insights and strategies derived from this analysis can help the company improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately driving long-term business success.
